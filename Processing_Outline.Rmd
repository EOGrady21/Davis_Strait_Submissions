# Data Cleaning 

Some initial data cleaning was done including 
- removing columns for variables without any data (empty data and flag columns)
- adding sounding column with data from log sheets


# OCADS Submission

Data was run through OCADS data and metadata generation scripts. Then submitted via SDIS (the OCADS submission platform).

# BioChem Submission

In progress!

First, cruise information was submitted to Jay Bugden to be loaded into OSC cruise.
