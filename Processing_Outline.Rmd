Processing Outline

Scope: Davis Strait data 2020-2022

Goals: Archive in BioChem, Submit to OCADS

# Data Cleaning 

Some initial data cleaning was done including 
- removing columns for variables without any data (empty data and flag columns)
- adding sounding column with data from log sheets


# OCADS Submission

Data was run through OCADS data and metadata generation scripts. Then submitted via SDIS (the OCADS submission platform).

OCADS_data_generation.R
OCADS_metadata_generation.R

# BioChem Submission

First, cruise information was submitted to Jay Bugden to be loaded into OSC cruise. 
(see osccruise_davisstrait.xlsx)

Then BCD and BCS tables were created based on extdata/biochem_dictionary.xlsx
